# TableOfContents

A component that generates a structured list of page headings, allowing easy navigation through sections of content.

export function PreviewContent() {

const scope = useRef(null)

return (

<div className="absolute inset-0 overflow-scroll p-10 grid grid-cols-2">
  <TableOfContents headingSelectors={{h2: '.h2'}} scope={scope} className="sticky top-0 h-fit" />
  <div ref={scope}>
    <div className="h2 text-primary text-md font-semibold mt-6">Boiled Eggs</div>
    <p className="text-primary/50 text-sm mt-1">
      Boiled eggs are like the introverts of the egg world, all cool and composed, just sitting
      there with their shell armor on. They’re the egg equivalent of someone who brings a book to a
      party. You never quite know what you’re gonna get until you crack them open—soft, gooey
      surprise or firm, no-nonsense center. And let’s not forget the peeling process, a suspenseful
      game of "Will it come off in one perfect piece, or will I be picking at tiny shards of shell
      for the next five minutes?"
    </p>
    <div className="h2 text-primary text-md font-semibold mt-6">Fried Eggs</div>
    <p className="text-primary/50 text-sm mt-1">
      Fried eggs are the drama queens of breakfast. There’s nothing subtle about that dramatic
      sizzle as they hit the pan, and let’s be honest, they demand to be noticed. The yolk sits
      there like a bright yellow spotlight, daring you to break it with your toast. Will it be a
      clean dunk, or will you get yolk all over your plate, your hand, and somehow your shirt?
      Either way, it’s breakfast with flair—fried eggs are here to put on a show!
    </p>
    <div className="h2 text-primary text-md font-semibold mt-6">Scrambled Eggs</div>
    <p className="text-primary/50 text-sm mt-1 mb-20">
      Scrambled eggs are the wild cards—anything goes with these. One minute they’re a soft, creamy
      cloud; the next, they’re dry little curds, depending on how distracted you got checking
      Instagram. They’re the ones that embrace chaos, happy to be mixed with cheese, veggies, or
      whatever’s in the fridge that’s about to go bad. Scrambled eggs are basically breakfast
      improv, and every batch feels like it comes with its own quirky personality.
