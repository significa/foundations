# Theming

We opted to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) because of its flexibility and utility-first design. Given that this project is focused on providing foundational code, we've kept the configuration minimal and straightforward.

<FileCode path="tailwind.config.cjs" filename="tailwind.config.cjs" />

## Colors

For the color system, we've defined three key color tokens: _background_, _primary_, and _accent_. These colors, combined case-specific alpha values, are used consistently and exclusively across the components.

<div className="mt-6 grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <ColorCard token="background" className="border border-primary/20">
    {'Background'}
  </ColorCard>
  <ColorCard token="primary" className="text-background">
    {'Primary'}
  </ColorCard>
  <ColorCard token="accent"> {'Accent'}</ColorCard>
</div>

Please be aware that, theme-wise, copying a component into your project will rarely be a plug-and-play solution: you will often need to adapt the component to match the theme and design of your existing project.

## Utilities

We use two libraries, [`clsx`](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx#readme) and [`tailwind-merge`](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge#readme), to make working with Tailwind classes easier and more efficient:

- `clsx` helps conditionally apply class names. It lets you easily add or remove Tailwind classes based on component props or state.
- `tailwind-merge` works with `clsx` to automatically resolve any conflicting Tailwind classes, like when you apply different padding or margin values. It ensures that the right styles are applied without conflicts.

We combine both `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` in a custom `cn` utility, which we import from `lib/tailwind`, to handle class management in one simple function.

### Install

```bash copy
npm install clsx tailwind-merge
```

<FileCode path="lib/tailwind.ts" filename="lib/tailwind.ts" />

### Example

```tsx copy /cn/
export function Component({ disabled, className }) {
  return (
    <div
      className={cn(
        'relative p-12',
        disabled ? 'cursor-not-allowed' : 'cursor-auto',
        className
      )}
    >
  );
}
```
