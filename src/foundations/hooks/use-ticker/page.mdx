## API Reference

<PropsTable
  definition={{
    callback: {
      type: "(timestamp: number, delta: number) => void | boolean",
      description: "The callback to call on each tick.",
      required: true,
    },

/>

The hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `start`: A function to start the ticker.
- `stop`: A function to stop the ticker.
- `paused`: A boolean indicating if the ticker is paused.

## About `requestAnimationFrame`

`requestAnimationFrame` is a browser API that schedules a callback to be executed before the next browser repaint. It's the recommended way to create animations and game loops as it automatically synchronises with the browser's refresh rate.

You can read a more in-depth overview of `requestAnimationFrame` on our blog: **[Mastering JavaScript Web Animations](https://significa.co/blog/master-javascript-web-animations)**.
