## Features

- **Scroll Snap Support** - Seamlessly works with CSS scroll-snap properties for precise control
- **Multi-Axis Support** - Handles both horizontal and vertical scrolling directions
- **Native Scroll Integration** - Preserves native scrolling behavior for wheel and touch events, allowing for a seamless cross-device experience

## API Reference

The hooks returns an object with a `ref` that you can attach to an element.

## Examples

### Basic

<Preview slug="use-mouse-pan" />

### With Snap

<Preview slug="use-mouse-pan-snap" />

### Both Axis

<Preview slug="use-mouse-pan-axis" />

### Simple Carousel

<Preview slug="use-mouse-pan-carousel" />

## Best Practices

For better usability, set the cursor to `grab` by default and `grabbing` when actively panning (`"cursor-grab active:cursor-grabbing"`, if using Tailwind). This provides a clear visual indication that the element is draggable.
