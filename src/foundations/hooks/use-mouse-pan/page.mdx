## Features

- Enables mouse panning (click and drag) to scroll elements
- Smooth momentum scrolling after releasing the drag
- Supports both horizontal and vertical scrolling
- Works with CSS scroll snap properties
- Preserves native scrolling behavior when using mousewheel/trackpad

## API Reference

The hooks returns a `ref` that you can attach to an element.

## Examples

### Basic

<Preview slug="use-mouse-pan" />

### With Snap

<Preview slug="use-mouse-pan-snap" />

### Both Axis

<Preview slug="use-mouse-pan-axis" />

## Best Practices

For better usability, set the cursor to `grab` by default and `grabbing` when actively panning (`"cursor-grab active:cursor-grabbing"`, if using Tailwind). This provides a clear visual indication that the element is draggable.
