  files: [
    "src/foundations/hooks/use-tailwind-breakpoint/use-tailwind-breakpoint.ts",
  ],
};

## Features

- **Tailwind Integration**: Uses tailwindcss breakpoints from the default config
- **SSR Compatible**: Works seamlessly with server-side rendering

## API Reference

### useTailwindBreakpoint

<PropsTable
  definition={{
    breakpoint: {
      type: "Breakpoint",
      description: "The Tailwind CSS breakpoint to observe.",
    },
  }}
/>

> **Note**: The actual available breakpoints depend on your Tailwind configuration. If you have custom screen tokens defined in your `theme`, those will also be available.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

<Preview slug="use-tailwind-breakpoint" />

## Best Practices

1. **Breakpoint Consistency**:

   - Use `useTailwindBreakpoint` with Tailwind breakpoint names for consistency with your CSS

2. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Use Tailwind classes for visual responsive design
   - Use the hook for JavaScript logic, state management, and conditional rendering
   - Don't duplicate responsive logic in both CSS and JavaScript
