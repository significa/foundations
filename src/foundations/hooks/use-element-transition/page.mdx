- **Status Tracking**: Provides transition status states for fine-grained control
- **Animation-Aware**: Automatically detects CSS animations and transitions, supporting disabled animations via CSS

## API Reference

<PropsTable
  definition={{
    shouldMount: {
      type: "boolean",
      required: true,
      description:
        "Controls whether the element should be mounted or unmounted",
    },
  }}
/>

The hook returns an object containing:

- `ref` (`RefObject<T>`): A ref object to attach to the element you want to transition
- `isMounted` (`boolean`): Whether the element should be rendered in the DOM
- `status` (`"unmounted" | "initial" | "open" | "closed"`): The current transition status
