## Prerequisites

- A [React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19) project.
- [Tailwind 4](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta) installed and configured.

> We are using React 19. If you still on 18, please check the [React 19 migration guide](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide).  
> A few common changes are:
>
> - `ref` is now a prop like the others, so we don't need to use `forwardRef`.
> - `<Context>` as a provider: You can now render `<Context>` as a provider instead of `<Context.Provider>`.
> - `use` can be used instead of `useContext`.
> - `MutableRefObject` is now `RefObject`.
>
> It's possible to use these components in React 18, but you will have to adapt the code as needed.

> We are using Tailwind 4 (beta). If you are using an older version, adapt as needed.

## Installation

Install the core dependencies:

```bash
npm install cva@beta tailwind-merge
```

> We are using CVA 1.0.0 (beta). Check what's new in [their docs](https://beta.cva.style/getting-started/whats-new).
