## Features

- **Automatic Progression**: Items advance automatically based on configurable durations
- **Progress Indication**: Exposes a `--progress` css variable to show progression through each item, and a `--index` css variable to show the current index
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for manual navigation
- **ARIA Support**: Full accessibility implementation with proper ARIA attributes
- **Unstyled**: No default styles, just the sequence behavior
- **Intersection Observer**: Pauses progression when not in viewport

## API Reference

### Sequence

The root container component that manages the state and behavior of the sequence.

<PropsTable
  definition={{
    duration: {
      type: "number | number[]",
      description:
        "The duration of the sequence in milliseconds. If an array is provided, it will be used to set the duration of each item individually.",
      required: true,
    },
    orientation: {
      type: '"horizontal" | "vertical"',
      description: "The orientation of the sequence.",
      default: '"horizontal"',
    },
    loop: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Whether the sequence should loop.",
      default: "false",
    },
    paused: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Whether the sequence should be paused.",
      default: "false",
    },
    currentIndex: {
      type: "number",
      description: "The controlled index of the active item.",
    },
    onChange: {
      type: "(index: string) => void",
      description: "Callback triggered when the active item changes.",
    },
    asChild: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Whether to merge props onto the child element.",
    },
  }}
/>

### SequenceItems

The container for sequence items.

<PropsTable
  definition={{
    asChild: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Whether to merge props onto the child element.",
    },
  }}
/>

### SequenceItem

The individual sequence item button component.

<PropsTable
  definition={{
    asChild: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Whether to merge props onto the child element.",
    },
  }}
/>

### SequencePanels

The container for sequence panels.

<PropsTable
  definition={{
    asChild: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Whether to merge props onto the child element.",
    },
  }}
/>

### SequencePanel

The individual sequence panel component.

<PropsTable
  definition={{
    forceMount: {
      type: "boolean",
      description:
        "Whether to always mount the panel, regardless of whether it is active.",
      default: "false",
    },
    asChild: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Whether to merge props onto the child element.",
    },
  }}
/>

## Examples

### Vertical Orientation

<Preview slug="sequence-vertical" />

### As Child

<Preview slug="sequence-as-child" />

### Animate Presence

To make `AnimatePresence` work with `SequencePanel` and maintain accessibility, you need to jump through a few hoops. Because `SequencePanel`'s conditional rendering is only applied to its children, you need to force the panel to mount and unmount with a different key to trigger `AnimatePresence`'s `exit` animation. This example demonstrates how you would do it.

<Preview slug="sequence-motion" />

### Controlled

<Preview slug="sequence-controlled" />

### Pause on Hover

<Preview slug="sequence-pause-hover" />

### Scroll Into View

The root `Sequence` component exposes an `elements` argument in its `onChange` prop that allows you to manipulate the active items. This example demonstrates how to scroll the active item into view.

<Preview slug="sequence-scroll-into-view" />
