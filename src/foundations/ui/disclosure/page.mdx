      <DisclosureChevron />
    </DisclosureTrigger>
    <DisclosureContent />
  </Disclosure>
</DisclosureGroup>
```

## API Reference

### Disclosure

Extends the `div` element.

<PropsTable
  definition={{
    defaultOpen: {
      type: "boolean",
      description:
        "Whether the element is open by default. Useful when used as an uncontrolled component.",
    },
    open: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "You can control the `open` state directly",
    },
    onOpenChange: {
      type: "(open: boolean) => void",
    },
  }}
/>

### DisclosureTrigger

Extends the `button` element.

<PropsTable
  definition={{
    asChild: {
      type: "boolean",
    },
  }}
/>

### DisclosureContent

Extends the `div` element.

### DisclosureChevron

Extends the `span` element.

Will render a caret that rotates when the disclosure is open.

### DisclosureGroup

If you want to only allow one disclosure to be open at a time, you can wrap your disclosures in a `DisclosureGroup`.

## Examples

### Simple

<Preview slug="disclosure" />

### Exclusive

Wraps your disclosures in a `DisclosureGroup` to ensure only one disclosure is open at a time.

<Preview slug="disclosure-exclusive" />

### With chevron

<Preview slug="disclosure-chevron" />

### Styled

<Preview slug="disclosure-styled" layout="padded" />

## Building an `Accordion` component

The `Disclosure` component serves as a low-level building block that enables progressive disclosure functionality in any UI element that requires it.

You can easily use it to build a more opinionated `Accordion` component, like the example above.

```tsx
import {
  Disclosure,
  DisclosureContent,
  DisclosureTrigger,
  DisclosureChevron,
  DisclosureGroup,
} from "../disclosure";

const AccordionGroup = ({
  children,
  className,
}: React.ComponentProps<"div">) => {
  return (
    <DisclosureGroup>
      <div className={cn("rounded-lg border", className)}>{children}</div>
    </DisclosureGroup>
  );
};

const Accordion = ({
  children,
  className,
}: React.ComponentProps<typeof Disclosure>) => {
  return (
    <Disclosure className={cn("border-b last:border-b-0", className)}>
      {children}
    </Disclosure>
  );
};

const AccordionTrigger = ({
  children,
  className,
}: React.ComponentProps<typeof DisclosureTrigger>) => {
  return (
    <DisclosureTrigger
      className={cn(
        "hover:bg-foreground/5 flex cursor-pointer items-center justify-between gap-4 px-3 py-2 transition-colors",
        className
      )}
    >
      {children}
      <DisclosureChevron />
    </DisclosureTrigger>
  );
};

const AccordionContent = ({
  children,
  className,
}: React.ComponentProps<typeof DisclosureContent>) => {
  return (
    <DisclosureContent>
      <div className={cn("border-t px-3 py-2", className)}>{children}</div>
    </DisclosureContent>
  );
};
```

## About the use of `motion`

The usage of `motion` in this component is temporary as it's not worth it to develop a custom solution when [calc-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc-size) is almost available.

As most projects we do already include `motion`, using it here is pretty much inconsequential.

If you need a leaner approach, feel free to remove it.
