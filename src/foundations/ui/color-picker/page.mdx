      default: "[0, 1, 1, 1]",
    },
    onColorChange: {
      type: "(color: HSVA) => void",
      description:

## Best Practices

1. **Color Format**:

   - Use HSVA format internally for consistent color manipulation
   - Convert to appropriate formats (HEX, RGB, HSL) for display or export
   - Consider alpha channel support when needed

2. **Layout and Composition**:

   - Combine different picker parts based on your use case
   - Use Area + Hue for most common scenarios
   - Add Alpha slider when transparency is needed
   - Consider space constraints when choosing components

3. **Accessibility**:

   - Ensure sufficient contrast between handles and backgrounds
   - Test keyboard navigation thoroughly
   - Provide clear labels for screen readers
   - Consider users with color vision deficiencies
